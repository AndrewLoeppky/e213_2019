# # Introduction to computational methods
#
# This notebook introduces a python program to integrate daily average flow into and out of
# the tailings management facility (TMF), and the volume of water in the TMF through time.
#
# ## Data file
# This notebook assumes that a comma-separated variable (csv) file named `july2016-tmf-flow.csv`
# exists in the current working directory. The file contains three columns with headers:
#
# `date` `outflow` `inflow`
#
# The first 4 lines of the file are:
#
# `date,outflow,inflow
# 2016-07-01,0.0703,0.1181
# 2016-07-02,0.066,0.1121
# 2016-07-03,0.0621,0.1079`
#
# The data in the csv file is in the following format
#
# `date` is in `yyyy-mm-dd`
#
# `outflow` is the daily average outflow in $m^3/s$
#
# `inflow` is the daily average inflow in $m^3/s$
#
#
#
# ## Algorithm
# The volume of water in the TMF on day $t$ of the computation is $V(t)$, the daily average outflow is $Q_{out}$
# and the daily average inflow is $Q_{out}$
#
# The basic computational algorithm is:
#
# 1. Read in the date, $Q_{out}$ and $Q_{out}$ data from the file `july2016-tmf-flow.csv`.
# 2. Compute the change in volume over the day $\Delta V = (Q_{in} - Q_{out})\Delta t$
# 3. Update the volume of the TMF: $V(t+\Delta t) = V(t) + \Delta V$
# 4. Loop through all dates in the file until complete.

# ## Python code
# We'll introduce python concepts as we go in the course, so we don't expect you to fully understand
# this code yet. We'll therefore only provide a cursory explanation here.

# ## Python modules/libraries
# It is good practice to import libaries at the beginning of a program. Libaries are collections of python code.
#
# %% {"lines_to_next_cell": 2}
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


# %% [markdown]
# The `import` command tells python to import the library. The `as` specifies a user - chosen nickname for library
# to be used in this program. So for this program, the `numpy` library will also be known as `np`.
#
# We are importing four libraries or library sections:
#
# `numpy` is a library with numerical - related codes. We'll use it alot in the course.
#
# `pandas` is a libary with codes to manipulate tabular data, that is data organized in rows and columns.
#
# `matplotlib` is a vast library for plotting. We don't need the whole library, but only two subsections.
#
# `matplotlib.pyplot`, nicknamed `plt` is a subsection containing so-called handle graphics. We'll use it alot.
#
# `matplotlib.dates`,  which we nickname `mdates` is a specialty subsection containing code for manipulating date formats.
#

# %%
# use pandas to read in csv data
data_file = "data/july2016-tmf-flow.csv"
df_flow = pd.read_csv(data_file)
df_flow.head()

# %% [markdown]
# The `pd.read_csv` command from the `pandas` library reads all the rows and columns from the file `july2016-tmf-flow.csv`.
#
# We could have also written the command as `pandas.read.csv`, but we used our nickname `pd` to save some typing.
#
# Here we see the power of the pandas library. This command contains code to open the file, read in each line of data from the
# csv file,and then stores that data in a `dataframe` that we named `flow`. You can think of a `dataframe` as rows and
# columns of data. In our case, the data in the `dataframe` is dates, outflows and inflows.

# %% [markdown]
# ## convert flow to a numpy array

# %%
flow = df_flow.values

# find number of days of data (number of rows in array)

n = flow.shape[0]
print(f"Number of days in file: {n}")
flow[:4, :]

# %% [markdown]
# This line of code uses the `.shape` method, which returns the dimension (number of rows and columns) in the dataframe
# `flow`. `.shape[0]` is the number of rows, or in our case, the number of days of outflow and inflow data in the dataframe,
# which we assign to the variable `n`.
#
#

# %%
# allocate np arrays for time and volume for calculations -
# doing this in advance makes python run faster

v = np.zeros(n, float)

# %% [markdown]
# The function `zeros` from the numpy library creates an array of zeros. Python runs faster if the arrays used for computation
# are defined in advance, versus on the fly. Here we create an array `v` of `n` zeros of type `float`. Each element in
# `v` will store the volume of water in the TMF on a specific day.

# %% {"lines_to_next_cell": 2}
# print  the columns in the dataframe
print(f"Columns in csv file: {df_flow.columns}")

# convert column called date to pandas date format
# and store in column called yearmonthday

df_flow["yearmonthday"] = pd.to_datetime(df_flow["date"])

# see the data in the column yearmonthday
print(f"type of the timestap object: {type(df_flow['yearmonthday'][0])}")


# %% [markdown]
# We first print the names of the columns in the dataframe that were read in from the `csv` file.
# We do this using the `.columns` method on the `flow` dataframe; that is `flow.columns` returns the indices of
# the columns in the dataframe.
#
# The command `flow["yearmonthday"] = pd.to_datetime(flow["date"]` uses the pandas method `.to_datetime`
# to convert the data in the column indexed with `date` in the dataframe `flow` to a date format that pandas
# understands, and then stores those panda dates in the dataframe `flow` in a new column with index `yearmonthday`.
#
# We then print out the type of the data in the column `yearmonthday` to prove that it is now a date.

outflow = flow[:, 2]
for i in range(n - 1):
    v[i + 1] = v[i] + (inflow[i] - outflow[i]) * seconds_per_day

df_flow["volume"] = v


# %% [markdown]
# This is the guts of the computation. We first set the volume in the TMF at time zero to $8.1\times 10^6 m^3$.
#
# Then we loop through the days in the dataframe and compute the change in volume over each day as described above:
# $V(t+\Delta t) = V(t) + (Q_{in} - Q_{out})\Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is $86400$ seconds (one day).
#
# In python we use a `for` loop. The command `for i in range(n - 1):` sets `i` to `0`, then enters the loop and when finished the loop,
# sets `i` to `1`, enters the loop,..., `n-1`.
# On the last time through the loop, `i=n-1` so that when we compute`v[i+1]` for the last time, we are computing `v[n]`.
#
# The rest of the code is used to generate the plot of outflow and inflow over time in on subplot,
# and volume of water in the TMF over time in another subplot.
