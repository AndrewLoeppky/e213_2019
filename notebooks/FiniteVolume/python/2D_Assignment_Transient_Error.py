# # 2D Transient simulation
#
# ## Learning Goals
#
# - Formulate and solve a 2D diffusion problem with inhomogeneous diffusion
# - Assess the accuracy by comparing the solution of a homogeneous problem to an analyitical solution
# - Define the gridsize and timesteps to have reasonable computation time vs accuracy
# - Use this approach to model a more complicated problem
# - Use simple python classes to organize parameters
#
# ## Context
#
# We want to study the diffusion of a contaminant in a geological context. The different geological layers and zones induce that the diffusion is not the same in every direction. We want to model these effects that diffusion is stopped on some boundary, that diffusion avoids certain areas of low diffusivity, ...
#
# To start that, we need a transient 2D model whose parameters are well defined. In order to assess the accuracy of the method, we will start by using the approach on simple cases for which an analytical solution is known. That will allow to define the timestep, gridsize, to have a reasonable agreement with analytical solution.
#
# From then, we will be able to model any similar situation.
#
# ## Boundary conditions
#
# Different types of boundary conditions can be encountered. So far, we have only used a boundary condition specifying the value of the unknown at one point (these are called Dirichlet boundary condition). In some case, a flux  is specified as a boundary condition, e.g. a certain amount of water/gas is injected at one boundary at a rate of 1 kg/s. These conditions will specify the derivative of the unknowns.
#
# A usual boundary condition is a no-flux boundary condition, meaning the solutes cannot go through a boundary. No diffusive flux means that the difference in concentration is zero. Thus, it specifies a zero-derivative at the boundary. Physically, this represents particle bouncing on a reflecting surface: every particle colliding with the surface is reflected back. Therefore, zooming on the boundary, the derivative of the concentration is zero.
#
# ## Transient diffusion from a constant-concentration boundary
#
# Let us describe the diffusion of a contaminant with concentration c in soils where a constant concentration $c_0$ is fixed at one boundary. It can be shown that the analytical solution to such a problem can be represented by the following equation:
#
# \begin{equation}
# c(x,t) = c_0  \text{erfc}\left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{4Dt}}  \right)
# \end{equation}
#
# where erfc$(x)$ is the error function, t is time ad D is the diffusivity. Let us look at this solution for different timesteps.

# ### Quantification of the error
#
# One may realize that the previous visualization of the error is not particularly helpful. We would like to quantify the error using only one real number, so that comparison is easier. This is the concept of the *norm*. It is defined in "numpy.linalg.norm". The norm of a vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ is usually written
#
# \begin{equation}
# \lvert \lvert \overrightarrow{x}\lvert\lvert
# \end{equation}
#
# There exists many type of norm
#
# Norm-1:
#
# \begin{equation}
# \lvert\lvert\overrightarrow{x}\lvert\lvert_1 = \sum_i^N |x_i|
# \end{equation}
#
# Norm-2 (notion of distance)
#
# \begin{equation}
# \lvert\lvert\overrightarrow{x}\lvert\lvert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i^N |x_i|^2}
# \end{equation}
#
#
# The infinte-norm:
#
# \begin{equation}
# \lvert\lvert\overrightarrow{x}\lvert\lvert_\infty = max_i  \{ |x_i| \}
# \end{equation}
#
# We can also define the n-norm, but the three previous one are most commonly used.
#
# \begin{equation}
# \lvert\lvert\overrightarrow{x}\lvert\lvert_n = \sqrt[n]{\sum_i^N |x_i|^n}
# \end{equation}
#
# Use the 2nd norm ( np.linalg.norm() ) to see the evolution of the global error with the timestep.

# Now see the influence of modifying the number of gridblocks and timestep and choose a good compromise between accuracy, and computation time.
#
# What we want you to do, is to convert one of the previous cell, which does the computation of the solution and the error. That function should return one single real number, representing the norm of the error. We want you to define several timestep and gridsize (4-5 values max for each, otherwise computation time might be too important). So, loop over the different timesteps and gridsize you have chosen, call the function for each situation, and store the return of the function as an error.
#
# In the end, we want you to plot the error in function of the timestep and gridsize, and chose the timestep you think is the best. A good compromise between accuracy and computation time is usually the best. In the rest of the assignment, we will go 2D. So, if your choice from here results in a too high computation time, the 2D calculation will take an important amount of time.

# ### 2D transient diffusion in homogeneous media
#
# Going from 1 to 2 dimensions changes nothing conceptually. There are, however a couple of changes required for the coding perspective. Indeed, whether the problem is 1D or 2D or 3D, the stucture of the system of equation Ac = b is the same. Matrix $A$ will always be a $n \times n$ matrix, while $c$ and $b$ will always be column vector of size $n$. In 2D, $n = n_x \times n_y$, while in 3D, it will be $n = n_x \times n_y \times n_z$.  The individual equation for a cell still
# produces a single row in the A and b matrices, but in 2D that cell has 4 neighbours instead
# of 2, and 3D it has 6 neighbors intead of 4.
#
# However, the fact is that in every case, the solution is stored in one vector, representing either a 1/2/3D solution. For these higher dimension problems, a two-way conversion between vector and matrix is required. To plot the 2D result, for example, we will use colourmap plots, which require the solution to be plotted to be represented as a 2D array (matrix).
#
# The function vec2mat(...) (specifically $vector\ to\ matrix$) does this: it converts a vector into the relevant 2D matrix, using n_x and n_y.
#
# The reverse function is usually required to initialize the initial condition. It is mac2vec(...). These two functions are defined here below.

# ##  Conclusions
#
# What you may have noticed, is that, even for small simple 2d transient problems like the one you have just solved, the computation times are already becoming significant...
#
# This is partly because we are dealing with big matrix which are filled with zeros. It is a complete waste of time and memory to deal with all of these 0 values. There are other ways to make our calculation way faster. We will probably dedicate a lecture to understand how we can improve this.
