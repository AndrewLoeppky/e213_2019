# ## 2D transient diffusion in homogeneous media
#
# Going from 1 to 2 dimensions changes nothing conceptually. There are, however a couple of changes required for the coding perspective. Indeed, whether the problem is 1D or 2D or 3D, the stucture of the system of equation Ac = b is the same. Matrix $A$ will always be a $n \times n$ matrix, while $c$ and $b$ will always be column vector of size $n$. In 2D, $n = n_x \times n_y$, while in 3D, it will be $n = n_x \times n_y \times n_z$.  The individual equation for a cell still
# produces a single row in the A and b matrices, but in 2D that cell has 4 neighbours instead
# of 2, and 3D it has 6 neighbors intead of 4.
#
# However, the fact is that in every case, the solution is stored in one vector, representing either a 1/2/3D solution. For these higher dimension problems, a two-way conversion between vector and matrix is required. To plot the 2D result, for example, we will use colourmap plots, which require the solution to be plotted to be represented as a 2D array (matrix).
#
# The function vec2mat(...) (specifically $vector\ to\ matrix$) does this: it converts a vector into the relevant 2D matrix, using n_x and n_y.
#
# The reverse function is usually required to initialize the initial condition. It is mac2vec(...). These two functions are defined here below.

# ##  Conclusions
#
# What you may have noticed, is that, even for small simple 2d transient problems like the one you have just solved, the computation times are already becoming significant...
#
# This is partly because we are dealing with big matrix which are filled with zeros. It is a complete waste of time and memory to deal with all of these 0 values. There are other ways to make our calculation way faster. We will probably dedicate a lecture to understand how we can improve this.
