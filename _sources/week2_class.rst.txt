Important points for the Jan. 8 class
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. To clone the repository from a cocalc terminal::

     git clone https://github.com/phaustin/eosc213_students.git

#. **Always** rename your notebook to something unique (doesn't matter what) before
   you start work.  It you don't, then the next item will bite you at some point.


#. At the start of a new assignment, or when we announce important repository changes/bugfixes, sync
   with our changes by doing the following::

     git fetch
     git reset --hard origin/master

   This will overwrite every file that you haven't renamed, so make sure your work is safe before you do this!.

#. Don't use the cocalc chat icon for questions -- cocalc only has 4 employees, and we should give them a break if possible.  Try us on piazza, and we will forward to cocalc if we don't know the answer.

#. Workflow for this course:

   #. login to cocalc.com and sync to get the new assignment
   
   #. Work on your copy of the notebook using your cocalc account

   #. Download the ipynb file to your local machine when complete

   #. Upload that file to the appropriate canvas assignment

   #. We will grade and then comment on the assignment with a url you can go to see our
      corrections/remarks (if any).
