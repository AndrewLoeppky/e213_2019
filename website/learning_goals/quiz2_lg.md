Our second quiz is scheduled for Thursday, February 28. It will be 30
minutes long in pen and paper format. Bring a calculator.


The learning goals for this quiz are:

Finite Volume method

  - Be able to derive a general finite-volume stencil, either
    steady-state or transient, in one or two dimensions given the
    geometry of the gridblocks, expressions for fluxes (eg, Fick’s law).
    You will not be given the general stencil (N S E W) in a quiz.
  - Be able to determine the dimensions of terms in an expression from
    the dimensions of other variables and terms in the equation.
  - Be able to incorporate sources and sinks in a finite-volume stencil.
  - Be able to write discrete approximations for Fick’s law in porous
    media.
  - Be able to write the appropriate equations for a gridblock in a
    finite-volume mesh, including gridblocks on the boundary.
  - Be able to place the equations/coefficients in a system matrix A,
    and right-hand side vector b.
  - Be able to compute fluxes between gridblocks given the values of the
    dependent variable in the gridblocks.
  - Be able to formulate stencils for both explicit and implicit
    time-stepping.
  - Be able to describe the advantages and disadvantages of explicit and
    implicit time-stepping schemes.

Simulation / python

  - Be able to read a code fragment in python (to the level covered in
    the notebooks given in class up to February 26, 2019), and recognize
    syntax errors.
  - Can define a function and pass mandatory (args) and optional
    (kwargs) arguments in and return values out using python. For
    reference see for example

    and explanation in
    <https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/08-defining-functions.html>
    .
  - Can use python figure and axis objects to make a line plot with
    multiple lines, including a legend. See
    <https://phaustin.github.io/eosc213/web_notebooks/Lec5_Euler.html>
    and
