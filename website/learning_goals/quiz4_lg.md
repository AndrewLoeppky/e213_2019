Our last quiz is scheduled for Thursday, March 28. It will
be 30 minutes in pen and paper format. Bring a calculator.


The learning goals for this quiz are:

Computational methods

  - Be able to develop finite-difference approximations for first and
    second derivatives (total and partial).
  - Be able to determine the truncation error and order of a finite -
    difference approximation from Taylor-series analysis.
  - Can construction forwards, backwards and central finite difference
    approximation stencils.
  - Can distinguish truncation error from roundoff error.
  - Can identify the controls truncation error, and recognize
    pathological situations which lead to large truncation errors.
  - Using a finite-difference stencil, can construct the system of
    equations for a finite-difference approximation to an ordinary or
    partial differential equation, including defining the grid of nodes
    and applying first-type (Dirichlet) and second-type (Neumann)
    boundary conditions.

Mathematics

  - Be able to read a partial differential equation:
      - distinguish between terms that represent fluxes, sources and
        storage of quantities within the volume (infinitesimal point).
      - recognize the order of the equation.
      - recognize conservative forms
      - recognize flux terms
      - understand the physical meaning of terms in a partial
        differential conservation law equation
      - identify dimensions of terms in equations
  - Be able to simplify a partial differential equation when
    coefficients are constant.

Be able to set up boundary value problem:

  - define domain of the problem.
  - define the equations that govern the dependent variable.
  - define the parameters of the equation, and if they are spatially
    homogeneous (do not vary in space) or heterogeneous.
  - distinguish between the principal boundary conditions that prevail.
  - assign initial conditions (if a time dependent problem).
  - Determine that a solution satisfies the boundary value problem.

Simulation / python

  - Pandas
      - Be able to use the apply method to execute a function on every
        row of a dataframe
      - Be able to add a column to a data frame and use groupby with
        that column to group dataframe rows into subset dataframes
      - Be able to do simple statistics (mean, median, max, min,
        summary) on dataframes and dataframe series
      - Be able to construct dataframes from lists of tuples, lists of
        dictionaries, or numpy arrays using from\_records member
        function
