The **final course grading rubric** is:

Notebooks / assignments: 30%

Quizzes (we'll take your best 3 of 4 total quizzes): 30 %;

Participation: 5 % (clickers);

Project: 20 %;

Final exam: 15%. 

**Quiz dates**:

February 5, February 28, March 14, March 28.

**Project Due Date:** April 5th - 5 pm**  
**

You will work in groups of 3 and prepare a computational project of your
choosing. We will ask for 1-page project proposals on Thursday, February
28, so start thinking about projects now. Your final deliverable will be
a notebook that describes your project and contains your code. 

Coding with partners is known to produce better results. See  **The
Friendship that Made Google Huge**:

Criteria

1.  Define a geological engineering-related computational problem with a
    clear objective.
2.  Describe the conceptual model, problem framework or computational
    issue. Demonstrate an understanding of the issues or fundamental
    processes related to the computational problem.
3.  Develop a computational description of the system - this could be
    mathematical, or statistical (data analysis or visualization). The
    description should include, if appropriate, diagrams, important
    parameters and their ranges.
4.  Produce a working code for the computational problem.
5.  Provide an interpretation of the results, discuss any limitations,
    etc.

We will provide a list of possible projects but I encourage you to
develop your own.

For example:

  - generalization of problems discussed in class to more complex
    situations (heterogeneous material properties, chemical reactions,
    etc).
  - computation of rock-fall trajectories on mountain slopes
  - computation of a rock or soil mass sliding down a surface
  - determination of material properties by analysis of test results
  - risk or Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainty
  - model of streamlines in subsurface groundwater flow
  - model of soil consolidation or liquefaction

Evaluation will consider project difficulty, complexity, and novelty,
appropriateness and quality of computational method, quality of python
implementation and presentation of results and visualization (if
appropriate).

The project should represent 20 to 40 hours total effort per person
between now and the project due date.
