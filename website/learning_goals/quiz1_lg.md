On Tuesday, Feb. 5, we will have our first quiz of the
course. The quiz will last 30 minutes and will be a traditional
pen-and-paper format.

The learning goals for this quiz are:

ODEs

  - Recognize an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
  - Recognize that the solutions to ODEs are FUNCTIONS, not single
    numbers.
  - Be able to determine the ORDER of an ODE.
  - Be able convert between the notations dy/dx, and y’.
  - Be able to recognize whether an ODE is linear or nonlinear.
  - Be able to write a simple differential equation model of a system,
    given the description of the system.
  - Identify information required to determine a particular solution
    (boundary and initial conditions) of an ODE.
  - Be able to confirm that a solution “solves” a given ODE.

Simulation / python

  - Be able to read a code fragment in python (to the level covered in
    the notebooks given in class up to January 24, 2019), and recognize
    syntax errors.
  - Be able to write the code to determine the type of a variable.
  - Be able to define a numpy array of a specified size in one or two
    dimensions
  - Be able write a simple loop over a specified range.
  - Be able to state the basic conservation principle (of mass)
  - Be able to take a conservation principle description in words (eg
    TMF) and convert it to a mathematical equation (algebraic or
    differential).
  - Be able to compute (by hand) the forward Euler approximation for one
    or two time steps, given a description of the conservation problem
    or ODE.
  - Be able to compute (by hand) the backward Euler approximation for
    one or two time steps, given a description of the conservation
    problem or ODE.
  - Be able to describe the relationship between time step and error in
    the Euler approximation.
  - Be able to compute the error in an Euler approximation, given the
    analytical solution to the problem.

We expect to return your graded notebooks by Monday or Tuesday of next
week.
